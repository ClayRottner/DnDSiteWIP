This site is primarily used to help people that have never looked at any Dungeons and Dragons player handbook 
with the daunting task of creating a character from scratch.

There is no outside information needed, no extra books, no giant encyclopedia to read before you can play.

Simply follow the instructions on the website and the conclusion will be a fully functioning character to use and enjoy.
