choice at higher levels.<br><strong>Spell Slots-</strong>The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot o f the spell’s level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.<br><strong>Spells Known-</strong>You know four 1st-level spells o f your choice from the
bard spell list. When you gain a level in this class, you

You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your

                <strong>Bardic Inspiration-</strong><br>You can inspire others through stirring w ords or music.
To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose
one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you
who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic
Inspiration die, a d6.
Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll
the die and add the number rolled to one ability check,
attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can
wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the
Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM
says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic
Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have
only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.You can use this feature a number o f times equal
to your Charisma modifier (a minimum o f once). You
regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach

the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips
of your choice at higher levels<br><strong>Preparing and Casting Spells</strong><br>You prepare the list o f cleric spells that are available

you do so, choose a number o f cleric spells equal to
your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of
one spell). The spells must be o f a level for which you

For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom
o f 16, your list o f prepared spells can include six spells
o f 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare
the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using
a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t
remove it from your list o f prepared spells.<br>
You can change your list o f prepared spells when you

requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.<br><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong><br>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.
The power o f your spells comes from your devotion to
your deity. You use your W isdom whenever a cleric spell
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use

DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier<br><strong>Ritual Casting</strong>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.<br><strong>Spellcasting Focus</strong>You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.<br><br><br><strong>Divine Domain-</strong><br>Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge,
Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each
domain is detailed at the end o f the class description,
and each one provides examples o f gods associated
with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other
features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants
you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you
gain that feature at 2nd level.<br><strong>Domain Spells</strong><br>Each domain has a list o f spells—its domain spells—
that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain
description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always
have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the
number o f spells you can prepare each day.<br>
If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the
cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</td>--->

attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever
a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier<br><strong>Ritual Casting</strong>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.<br><strong>Spellcasting focus</strong>You can use a druidic focus as a
spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</td>--->

            Your fellow guild members will provide you with

    <h2>Choosing your ability scores</h2>
    <p>Here we will choose how good or bad your character is in the 6 abilitie categories. Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution, and Charisma.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There are generally two ways of getting the points to allocate into the abilities:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Use a predefined set of stats (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8), distributing them as you like.</li><br>
    <li>Roll 4d6 and remove the lowest, adding the remaining 3 dice total to create a stat. Repeat 5 more times. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Please choose which way you would like to do it, and fill in each ability.</p>
